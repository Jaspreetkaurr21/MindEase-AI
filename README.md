# 🧠 MindEase — Your Personal Mental Health Companion

Welcome to **MindEase**, a mental health chatbot built using Flask and AIML, designed to help users track their feelings, manage stress, and express themselves freely through journaling and daily affirmations.

I created this project as a way to combine technology and empathy — to provide a space where anyone can talk, reflect, and feel heard. 💙

## 🧘‍♀️ Why I Built MindEase

Mental health is something I care deeply about. I wanted to create a space where users could:

* Talk freely (even with voice)
* Track their emotions and stress
* Write down their feelings in a private journal
* Get a little motivation every day 🌻

This is my attempt to mix **compassion with code** 💻💖
